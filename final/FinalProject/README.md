The purpose of this project was to make an alarm clock that lets the user choose different types of alarms.

To use this program you will need to first make an alarm setting it with a HH/MM format.
Note: This will only work in military time.

After creating your alarm please turn on the alarm clock (You can also see a list of currently active alarms).
Once turned on your alarm clock will be played once the time is hit and then be removed from the list of active alarm clocks.
